## Introduction

This repository houses demonstration code for my personal project https://FilmAdvise.com a project built with Nest.js. It's important to clarify that this codebase is incomplete and intended for demonstration purposes only. It illustrates a backend solution for a movie selection application and is not designed to be executed in a production environment.

## About the Project

FilmAdvise aims to streamline the process of choosing films by offering a detailed and personalized selection interface. This platform focuses on tailoring movie recommendations to individual tastes and preferences using a comprehensive set of selection criteria. These include genres, subgenres, tags, ratings, release years, countries of production, historical epochs, awards, and age restrictions, ensuring that users can find movies that fit their mood and interests perfectly.
